## Who

I'm Luiz Sena and I’ve a passion for physics and programming.

Recently I'm really enjoying the .net environment and trying to learn as much as possible, so most – but not exclusively – of my posts should be on this subject.

## Formation

I graduated in [Computational Physics](https://uspdigital.usp.br/jupiterweb/listarGradeCurricular?codcg=76&codcur=76040&codhab=0&tipo=N) from [University of São Paulo.](http://www5.usp.br/english/?lang=en) I studied a lot of cool things in my time there, but at the end my senior thesis was about _Nonlinearity and Solitons_.

I also have a technical certificate in [landsurveying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying) by [Federal University of Technology](http://www.utfpr.edu.br/). My completion work was entitled _“Coordinates transport analysis in screening time function using simple frequency GNSS receiver”._
