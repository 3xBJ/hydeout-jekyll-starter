Delegates are callbacks, a pointer to a - or a collention - of function(s). So you can pass a function as a argument to another or just storage a lot of them in one to call them _simultaneously_ at our will.

There are two wrappers to use delegate in C#

    Action<type a1, ..., type aN> MyAction;

Action<> has N arguments and accept any function that has the same arguments. Doesn't return anything - so we must pass a void function.

    Func<type a, type b, ... , type return> MyFunc;

Func<> has N arguments and one return type.

#### Passing a function as a parameter

If we just whant to go around using delegates, that it. With this  we can pass a function as a parameter
